      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an enthusiastic learner in full-stack web development with a passion for developing scalable and innovative websites. Currently pursuing a major in Full Stack Web Development at Red River College Polytech, I am looking for a Co-Op / Internship this fall with an expected graduation date of December 2024.</p>
      <p>I am actively seeking opportunities to join a collaborative team where I can continue to learn and grow while delivering high-quality, impactful solutions. My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in various technologies, including Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, PHP, and Python, among others. Additionally, I have gained valuable skills in project management, object-oriented system design, and web security.</p>
